  <h3 id="nutshell">Goal of this Project in a Nutshell</h3>
  <p>
    The goal of this project is to explore software engineering in the context
    of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and smart contracts based on the idea of a
    system for university credit management.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course we build software in this project group, but your task is also to
    develop plausible use cases that benefit from being implemented using DLT.
    You inspect security and privacy issues in these cases and carefully
    observe how (and if) the software engineering process changes because of the
    partial implementation of system on a blockchain. Of course you also argue
    why the DLT-based solution here has advantages over a centralized system and
    keep a watchful eye on its energy consumption - the Achilles' heel of DLT.

  <p>
    For your university credits you usually rely on a central authority
    (the examination office) to keep track of all of your course enrollments and
    grades you receive. They are the central point of all of your inquiries and
    manage really well in our case. However, you have to rely on their disaster
    recovery plans to work in case of an unforeseen event (e.g., fire, flooding,
    hacking attempts). This is a single point of failure and, moreover, you are
    not in technical control of your own data. Wouldn't it be nice if you would
    control the sharing of your own data with the parties necessary and not any
    other?
  </p>

  <p>
    Things get more complicated once you change instituions or enroll in a study
    program held by multiple universities. Then you have to jump through all
    sorts of hoops to get your home university to credit you for the grades you
    received at the other university. Even when the collaboration is decades old
    it is always a case by case decision. Wouldn't it be nice if you could rely
    on established trust relationsships and get accredited instantly?
  </p>

    <figcaption>First use case: Receive a credit token for a course</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Let's say you are in your first semester and take the first course. Of course
    at the end there is an exam and quite happily you pass it. The professor gives
    you a grade and publishes it to your university "wallet". They keep a copy of
    this transaction for a certain small period of time. For centralized record
    keeping this transaction is also sent to the university "blockchain" and
    retained there for a centain larger period of time. By german law this would
    be 10 years.
  </p>

    <figcaption>Second use case: Enrolling in a course with pre-requisites</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Later on in your studies you take a course where that particular course is a
    prerequisite. So your professor asks you to provide proof that you got your
    grade their. Luckily you have your token and send proof of that token. You
    would not need to if the professor still has the transaction in their
    blockchain, but for the sake of this example let's say this is a different
    professor now. Either way, you can provide this proof yourself and the
    professor can check that. They issue a new enrollment token and now you can
    participate in this course. Without the central administration having to work
    for that. Fun times!
  </p>

  <p>
    Do not feel bound by these use cases. In this project group you can go above
    and beyond the provided information and develop a blockchain-based solution
    in the university context.
  </p>

  <h3 id="stack">Proposed Application Stack</h3>

  <p>For this project, we propose an application stack consisting of the technologies below.
    If you are more satisfied with a different solution, we can speak about it.</p>

  <p>
    As all of these technologies will be new for you this year there will be no coding assignments.
    Instead, I ask you for a <em>Letter of Motivation</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your Letter of Movitation should answer (some of) the following questions:
    <ul>
      <li>What is your goal with choosing this project?</li>
      <li>Why do you think you are the right person for this project?</li>
      <li>What is your professional goal? Where would you like to work after receiving your Master's degree?</li>
      <li>What motivates you most in life?</li>
      <li>What is your best achievement so far?</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Avoid all kind of platitudes, flowery phrases and flattery.
    Deal with your topics in a reflective and factual way. Do not campaign for your beliefs.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can write either in English or in German.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are a few guidelines for writing such a letter:

      <li><a href="https://www.jobline.uni-muenchen.de/samples/letters_of_motivation/index.html">Example Letter (LMU Munich)</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/md/zuv/international/medien/how_to_write_a_letter_of_motivation.pdf">Writing a Letter of Motivation (Universität Heidelberg)</a> </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>As any project group we follow the standard "stabile marriage" process described <a href="https://www.uni-paderborn.de/cs/pg">on the PG website</a>. However, you can pre-register your letter by sending it to me via e-mail. It will not give you
    an advantage, but you will be considered as if you had submitted through the system. The advantage is that you can check it off in your to-do-list earlier.</p>

  <h3 id="support">Support</h3>
  <p>
    You will also be supported by <em>Jan-Niclas Strüwer</em> and <em>Johannes Düsing</em>.
    Both are alumni of the Delphi Project Group 2018/2019, accomplished Scala
    programmers, and also well-read into blockchain technology.
